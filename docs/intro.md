# Welcome to our blog!

The current war between Russia and Ukraine is unlike anything we have seen before, due in large part to the advancement and widespread availability of technology. Social media has made it incredibly easy to spread information, which can be a double-edged sword -- activists can use media in order to draw attention to critical causes, but on the other hand, state actors can take advantage of these platforms to spread disinformation as part of their information warfare strategies. Looking at things from a broader perspective, even just the ubiquity of the internet differentiates this war from many we have seen in the past. It results in the possibility of more complex cyberattacks, and is a necessity in enabling communication for those being impacted by the war. Beyond that, it’s played a significant role in access to cryptocurrency, which has benefitted both Ukraine’s ability to accept donations as well as Russia’s ability to circumvent foreign sanctions. Thanks to technology, it’s clear that this conflict is being fought on a brand new playing field, and this blog aims to provide an in-depth exploration of some of those issues.
