**Thesis Statement:**

The advancement and widespread availability of technology has created an environment for the Russia-Ukraine war that is unlike anything seen in the past. This conflict is being fought on a brand new playing field, and our project aims to provide an in-depth explanation of some of those tech issues.

Summarize the source using formal language. Use at least one in-text citation:

The current Russia-Ukraine war is one of the first conflicts to take place while social media usage is as prominent as it currently is. As a result of this, social media is being used for the widespread dissemination of disinformation. Ukraine has been well arare of the fact that it is fighting a war of disinformation, but Russia’s tactics so far have often seemed outdated, especially in comparison to Ukraine’s compelling videos of President Zelenskyy taking action. Platforms such as TikTok and Telegram, however, have been “rife with misinformation and disinformation” (Brown), especially since these platforms have not been removing potentially false content. Many social media users have begun to take advantage of their favorite platforms to stay in touch with friends and family more than ever before, putting “direct friendship relationships back into social media” (Brown).

Summarize the source using formal language. Use at least one in-text citation:

This article discusses the way Cryptocurrency has been impacting the war in Ukraine on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides. It brings up misconceptions about Russia avoiding sanctions with Bitcoin and how Bitcoin is becoming closer to a day-to-day currency in Ukraine, providing another example of economic innovation with a new economy “that rests on the unique virtues of crypto”

Evaluate the credibility of the source:

Discuss how this source applies to your topic/thesis:

We used this source to argue about the impact of cryptocurrency on the Russia-Ukraine war and ultimately came to the conclusion that while it is interesting that the emerging technology is being applied during the war, it is not going to make an overwhelming impact on the outcome except for few Russian citizens who are trying to escape sanctions. We used information from this article to show how instability makes cryptocurrency more useful.

Summarize the source using formal language. Use at least one in-text citation:

Videos from Ukraine have dominated social media feeds around the world since Russia began its invasion at the end of February. But how are so many people still online? Despite being attacked by a major military power with significant cyberwar capabilities, Ukraine’s Internet is still largely intact, allowing the millions of people who remain in the country to communicate, and giving the world a front-row seat to the war. Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, said “The fact that Internet networking and cellular largely works is remarkable.”

Evaluate the credibility of the source: 

This is an officially published article from The Washington Post, which I am fairly certain it is a credible source.

Discuss how this source applies to your topic/thesis:

This source talks a lot about the general status of the internet in Ukraine, as well as going into detail regarding the solutions being proposed and employed. It also provides a lot of the viral content going around from Ukraine. This was perfect for developing a post about the state of the internet in the Ukraine and Starlink, which was briefly discussed in this article.

Summarize the source using formal language. Use at least one in-text citation:

Since many of the internet centers across the country have been destroyed, Ukrainians have been resorting to other methods of connecting to the web, including Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite constellation. With over 10,000 terminals already operational in Ukraine, devastated cities like Mariupol have been able to reconnect to the grid. “According to Bornyakov, the Ukrainian government has been installing the Starlink dishes in areas hit hard by the Russian invasion. This includes the cities of Chernihiv and Mariupol, which the Russian military have attempted to take over.”

Evaluate the credibility of the source: 

PCMag is a very credible source that I have used many times in my previous articles. They list all of their sources as well, which are all quite credible in their own rights.

Discuss how this source applies to your topic/thesis:

The blog post about Ukraine’s internet is primarily focused on Starlink and its rollout in Ukraine so far, which is the primary subject of this article. This article also provided a lot of tweets and other statements from Elon Musk that were included in the blog post.

Summarize the source using formal language. Use at least one in-text citation:

Russia has a long history of information warfare and disinformation campaigns against Western democracies, especially the United States. There are four main strategies that Russia uses for information warfare, including “unprecedented budgets…modernized propaganda machinery...sophisticated technical expertise...and utilization by the Kremlin of the relative openness of Western media” (Ajir, Vaillant). In order to utilize these strategies, Russia relies on three different mediums -- these include maintaining control over Western media outlets, state-funded worldwide social media networks, and lobbying in Western society. 

Evaluate the credibility of the source: 

This article seems to be quite credible. It was published by Air University Press, which is a publisher that highlights Air Force education. They conduct research in air, space, and cyberspace power, as well as offering citizenship, degree granting, and professional continuing education programs. The journal itself is called Strategic Studies Quarterly, and as the name suggests, it focuses on US Air Force strategy. Additionally, the authors are professors of international relations at University of Nebraska-Omaha, so they are clearly experienced in this area. 

Discuss how this source applies to your topic/thesis:

This source provides a significant amount of background information and context to better understand Russia’s relationship with disinformation and information warfare. It gives a detailed explanation of how Russia has historically used information warfare, and it also pulls in some more modern-day information. This makes it really easy to draw connections to Russia’s current usage of information warfare, and to understand how its history is informing today’s conflict.

Interview with Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, who discusses the current state of the internet in Ukraine in regards to the rollout of Starlink in areas of the country hit hard by the war. ““Now there are thousands of Starlinks in Ukraine, been using them for different purposes, even in a war zone.”

Evaluate the credibility of the source: 

This video is a recording of a livestream from The Washington Post, which I am fairly certain is a credible source.

Discuss how this source applies to your topic/thesis:

Alex discusses Starlink and how much it is helping his country get back online. The blog post about Ukraine’s internet primarily focuses on the rollout of Starlink, so this is very relevant.

_All Quiet on the Cyber Front: Ukraine's Internet Infrastructure Remains Resilient_, FRANCE 24, 1 Apr. 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbxs77To0o. 

Summarize the source using formal language. Use at least one in-text citation:

An interview with Peter O’Brien, the tech editor at FRANCE 24. He discusses the cyber attacks at the beginning of the invasion and what kind of role cyber warfare and hacking is playing in the war now, before briefly touching on the rollout of Starlink in areas of Ukraine that have been hit particularly hard. “At the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hackers brought down tens of thousands of satellite internet modems across Ukraine and Europe. This week, Reuters revealed that the same attacks are still underway. It raises questions about the state of the cyberwar in Ukraine: given the piecemeal information we receive about an attack, weeks after it happened, how can we assess Russia's cyberoffensive?”

Evaluate the credibility of the source: 

This source seems fairly credible, though there is no way to be sure. FRANCE 24 has 2.39 million subscribers on YouTube, suggesting they are legitimate and provide truthful information.

Discuss how this source applies to your topic/thesis:

This source applies to both the post about the internet in Ukraine and to the post concerning the war of disinformation happening alongside the physical battle. Cyber warfare has played a significant part in this battle between Ukraine and Russia. Peter is very good at explaining how everything is going currently and why its going that way.

Summarize the source using formal language. Use at least one in-text citation:

This article covered three main areas. The first has to do with the multiple areas of disinformation that are currently being utilized in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Most of these center around social media -- and because of how easy it is to access social media, it is “giving way to widespread, individual contributions to mis or disinformation” (Diepeveen). The article next discusses Ukraine’s efforts to tackle disinformation, which is an area that the nation has been prioritizing since 2014. Finally, the last topic analyzed is Russia’s use of state-sponsored disinformation and repression. 

Evaluate the credibility of the source: 

This source appears to be fairly reliable. ODI, the website the article was published on, is an independent global affairs think tank. While they state that they do lead their own thinking and agendas, the information provided in the article does not appear to be biased, especially since it’s less of an opinion and more informational, with several other sources linked throughout.  

Discuss how this source applies to your topic/thesis:

This source is very relevant to our thesis since it covers disinformation in Russia and Ukraine, and gives a great explanation of up-to-date issues with these topics. It also has a good variety in covering multiple areas of disinformation, Ukraine’s response, and Russia’s actions, all of which are relevant to our issue of technology in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
