One of the fascinating things about this conflict between Ukraine and Russia is that it’s among the first conflicts featuring widespread coverage all over social media. There have been thousands of viral videos coming out of Ukraine during this crisis. <!--truncate-->Here, [the Ukrainian band Antytila reached out to Ed Sheeran about a live stream during his charity performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S8-c-qpv_Q). [This young girl was recorded singing “Let It Go” in a Ukrainian bomb shelter](https://twitter.com/Ankita20200/status/1500496884255051776). But many are wondering how exactly this is all possible. Shouldn’t the internet be offline in a warzone?

Experts assumed for a long time that in modern warfare, one of the first things that the enemy would target is the internet and, by extension, the communication networks that soldiers rely on to give orders and organize supply shipments. Some called it the “fourth battlefield” alongside land, air, and sea. In the first weeks of this conflict, Russia did significantly less than expected on this front. Most of Ukraine is still connected to the Internet, especially in major cities. Outages occur every day, but the overall infrastructure that powers the Internet has proven surprisingly resilient. Russia launched an effective cyberattack at the beginning of the invasion, [taking out ViaSat networks all over Europe](https://www.viasat.com/about/newsroom/blog/ka-sat-network-cyber-attack-overview/). Still, this attack impacted other countries just as much as Ukraine, disabling almost 6000 wind turbines in Germany. Since then, any attacks have been smaller and less destructive than expected, perhaps to avoid a global cyber war. Some experts suggested that Russian troops might have been relying on that infrastructure during the invasion. The Russian forces could have utilized Ukrainian networks to communicate or spread disinformation to Ukrainian troops. Another possibility is that they may have thought the invasion would be over by now, and they wanted that technology intact once they occupied the country. The most likely possibility is that Ukraine’s cybersecurity is far more capable than Russia expected. [Russia attempted another cyberattack back in 2015](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-cybersecurity-sandworm-idUSKBN0UM00N20160108), and Ukraine has improved its defenses substantially since then. Russia probably decided it was cheaper and easier to bomb rather than hack. The reality now is that cyber warfare has largely been sidelined, and many internet centers have been outright destroyed by Russian planes instead. There are many Internet service providers in Ukraine, and they are all working around the clock to keep the grid online, even repairing each other’s equipment. And as many as 15,000 amateur short-wave HAM radios are scattered around Ukraine, the owners of which have already begun assisting the Ukrainian government and military with communication. But despite all the effort, entire cities like Mariupol and Chernihiv have been cut off and limited to satellite phones to communicate with the rest of the country.

That’s where Starlink comes in. [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) is a branch of [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), an American aerospace manufacturer, space transportation service provider, and telecommunications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk to reduce the cost of transportation to space in the hopes of colonizing Mars within our lifetimes. But Starlink is a little different. Starlink is the name of a satellite network SpaceX has been dreaming of since 2004, and that began official development in 2015. Ever a romantic, Elon says the name is inspired by [*The Fault In Our Stars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fault_in_Our_Stars) by John Green. The first satellites arrived in space on the [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) rocket launched by SpaceX in 2019. Still, by now, there are over 2000 Starlink satellites in orbit around Earth, with plans to eventually support up to 42,000 satellites. It currently provides internet to 29 different countries, with over 250,000 subscribers. It was big news online when Elon Musk “donated” thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine to keep the internet on in places without any other options. It has since been revealed that various private donors and even the governments of France and Poland chipped in to help pay for the technology. Ukraine is now using over 10,000 Starlink dishes across the country. They have set up networks in the cities of Mariupol and Chernihiv and reconnected both to the rest of the country. Even the military uses Starlink to connect to drones and strike Russian positions. Some have questioned the potential security risks these terminals pose to Ukrainian intelligence, which Elon Musk himself mentioned. Still, interestingly enough, Russia has been largely ignoring the Starlink terminals. Elon also [warned that the Russian military might decide to bomb buildings with visible Starlink dishes on them](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1499472139333746691). He has suggested [keeping the dish away from people](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1499473384367079429) and [camouflaging it](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1499473797539250200). When he heard that the Russian military uses infrared technology to detect generators and other forms of powering the terminals, he recommended the Ukrainian government use the Starlink dishes with solar panels and battery packs to cut down on any generated heat. He also [updated](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1499442132402130951) the software to support a lower voltage, like a car charger, and to support roaming so the dish can broadcast the signal from a moving vehicle.

Overall the internet infrastructure in Ukraine has been shockingly resilient. The number of service providers across the country means there are fewer points of failure to target, and the fact that companies that generally compete are standing in solidarity together and repairing each other’s equipment is nothing short of commendable. But in places where Russia attempted to take over, the damage from the conflict has rendered many of the traditional methods of connecting to the internet unreliable or outright unusable. In these cases, Elon Musk’s Starlink has been a savior for thousands, connecting entire cities back to the grid and helping Ukraine fight back. And despite its shortcomings, Elon has pledged and followed through on updating and adapting the technology to suit the needs of the Ukrainian people best. As a result, I don’t see Starlink disappearing from the conversation when this conflict is over. On the contrary, it will be a developing force for years to come.
