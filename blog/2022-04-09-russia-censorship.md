Currently, Russia is using its influence to censor any words which refer to their actions in Ukraine as anything besides a "special military operation". According to a Russian protest monitoring group, about 15,000 people have been detained since the beginning of the "special military operation". A majority of the detainees have been fined rather than sentenced to prison time.

A recent law passed by lawmakers toughened up against "fake news" which threatens anyone who purposefully spreads "false information" about the Russian state bodies which operate abroad. These fines go up to 1.5 million rubles, or 13,000 Euros, and prison time up to 15 years. As stated on the Russian government website, this law and its corresponding amendments were passed to supplement the "norms already adopted and entered into the force" regarding "actions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation".

These crackdowns have mainly been affecting young people under 30s, as they are often more skeptical of the officials than their elders. But they are also wrongfully arresting citizens. Take for example Anna Afanasyev. She is a nursing student who alleges she had no intention of participating in the protests happening but was swept up in a police sweep along with other people in the back of a van two meters from the subway exit. After spending two nights in jail, she was fined lightly by a sympathetic judge. However, she was immediately expelled from her university for her "behavior incompatible of a doctor and medical student".
